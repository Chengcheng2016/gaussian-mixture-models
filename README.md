# gaussian-mixture-models  
Implementation of expectation maximization algorithm for gaussian mixture models and comparing it with non-parametric histogram estimation done for CS 551: Pattern Recognition course HW2 in Bilkent University.  

There is a report along with the code analyzing the given data in the homework. 

Run patternHw2_partA and part_B for the outputs in the reports. (you need to play with the parameters: cluster count, covariance type...)

Please reference before using.
